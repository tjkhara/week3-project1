// JavaScript Function Exercises

// 1. Define a function called "divideByTwo". It should accept one parameter called "number".
//    The function should divide the number by two and output the answer.

// 2. Define a function called "greeting". It should accept two parameters, which will be names.
//    The function should output the a greeting to both people.

// 3. You use Amazon Subscribe & Save to have six cans of cashews automatically sent to you each month, but the price keeps changing.
//    Write a function that takes the price per unit and calculates the total for you each month.

// 4. Write a function that accepts the following array and separates the people into two teams.
//    No names next to eachother in the array should be on the same team.
      teammates = ["Harold", "Bob", "Sue", "Grady", "Notorious B.I.G.", "JavaCrypt", "Weird guy in the back", "Gary", "Carol", "Hipster Tim", "Janet"]

// 5. Define a function called "quarter". It accepts one parameter called "number".
//    The function will return a value which is one quarter of the number provided.

// 6. Define functions called "area" and "perimeter". They should both accept two parameters and calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

// 7. Write a function called "sleepings", it should accept one parameter, an integer called "hours".
//    Write a conditional statement inside of the function. If the number of hours is more than 8, print a statement to the console about getting enough rest.
//    If the number of hours is less than 8, print a statement recommending the user get more shut eye.

// 8. Prompt a user to enter a three digit number. Write a function that adds the numbers together.
//    HINT: You may need to google how to turn a string into an integer.

// 9. You've finally gotten around to counting the change in your piggy bank. Write a function that accepts four parameters (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).
//     The function should take each number of coins and multiply it times each coin's value.
//     Finally, it should return the total amount of change you have in the following format: "$32.77"
//     HINT: Googling the toFixed method will help you with the format.

// 10. Develop a function that determines a person's age by prompting them for their birth year.

// 11. Write a function that takes a year and reports whether or not it is a leap year.
//     Remember, a leap year occurs:
//        On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
//        Except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
//        Unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
//        For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leapyear, but 2000 is.

// 12. Develop a function that cleans up a phone number entered by a user.
//     The rules are as follows:
//        If the phone number is less than 10 digits or more than 11 digits, assume that it is bad number
//        If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the last 10 digits
//        If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number.
//        HINT: You may need to use the charAt method.

// 13. Create a function that determines whether a parameter is a number or not.
//     Iterate over the elements in the following array to determine if each is a number.
//     HINT: You may need to use the isNaN method.
       arrayOfAllTheThings = ["one", 23, {thingsWhalesLove: "beaches"}, "six hundred", 33, 6834, "5,435"]

// 14. Create a die rolling function that accepts no parameters.
//     It rolls two six-sided-dice, adds the two numbers together, and returns a roll value.
//     To get the random number rolled by each die, use Math.random and Math.floor.

// 15. Using your die roll function above, figure out how many times it would take a user
//     to get around a Monopoly board once. A monopoly board has 40 spaces total.
